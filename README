"watch changes"

  Watch for changes to files within the current directory and run a command
  when they occur.

Requirements

  Only runs on OS X 10.7 (Lion). Sorry

Install

  npm install wach

Examples

  # Run `make` every time a file in the current directory is updated/added
  wach make

  # Compile and run on every change
  wach "gcc hello.c && ./a.out"

  # Only watch for changes to coffee files, compile the one that changed
  wach -o *.coffee, coffee -c @

  # Run the tests every time a ruby file changes
  TEST_DIR=generators wach -o **/*.rb, bundle exec rake test

Node API

  wach = require('../src/wach');
  wach('.', function(path) {
    return console.log("something happened to " + path + "!");
  })
