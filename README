  Watch for changes to files within the current directory and run a command
  when they occur.

Examples

  # Run `make` every time a file in the current directory is updated/added
  wach make

  # Only when .c files change
  wach -o *.c, make

  # Compile the .coffee file that changed
  wach -o *.coffee, coffee @

  # Run the tests every time a ruby file changes
  TEST_DIR=generators wach -o **/*.rb, bundle exec rake test
